    <!-- ABOUT / SUMMARY -->
    <section class="block">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a junior at UNC Charlotte studying Computer Science with a concentration in
        cybersecurity. Outside of class, I work as a server at Church and Union, where
        I’m trusted with closing duties and handling money. That same responsibility
        shows up in how I approach code, systems, and security.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now I’m focused on getting stronger at fundamentals: data structures, web
        development, operating systems, and networking, while slowly adding more
        security-focused projects.
